#Using Simiki

## Usage


- add markdown or directory in 	`content` directory  
- back to mywiki 
- `simiki g`
- `cd output`
- `git add .`  
- `git commit -m 'comment'`
- `git push -u origin gh-pages`

##Install  


For some reason I fail to use `pip install simiki` to install simiki.  
So I use

	sudo easy_install simiki
instead. It works well.	

Use following code to initialize simiki  
	
	simiki init
	simiki g
	simiki p  # preview pages generated by simiki


## Generate new wiki

Enter the directory where simiki was initialized  
Build a new Markdown file  
After that, enter code `simiki g`  
At the begin of every markdown
